    Welcome to this playground for coming up with ideas of nice-to-have and
    easy-to-work-with components and convenience tools created with Vue. The
    <a href="https://github.com/epursimuove/component-library-vue"
      >source code</a
    >
    can be found at GitHub.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first embryo of this component library saw the light in December 2024.
    Currently the following components can be found:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <RouterLink :to="{ name: 'Tabular Data' }">Tabular Data</RouterLink>,
      automagically creating tables with sorting, pagination and aggregation.
    </li>
  </ul>
